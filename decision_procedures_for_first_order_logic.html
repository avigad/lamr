<p>Given a propositional formula <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and a truth assignment <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span>,
we have seen that it is straightforward to test wither <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is true under <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span>.
We have also seen that a formula <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is valid if and only if it is provable,
and we have considered decision procedures for propositional logic that determine whether
that is the case.</p>
<p>In a similar way, given a first-order sentece <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and a model <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mdl M\)</span>,
we can ask whether <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is true in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mdl M\)</span>.
But for most fixed choices of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mdl M\)</span>, there is no algorithm to determine
whether or not <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is true. For example, there is no algorithm to determine whether
a sentence in a language with two binary function symbols is true of the model
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb{Z}, +, \times)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Given a first-order sentence <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>, we can also ask whether it is valid,
that is, true in all models.
Once we have suitable proof systems for first-order logic, this will be equivalent
to the question as to whether <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is provable.
If the language has a binary relation symbol or two unary functions, this, too, is undecidable.</p>
<p>But all is not lost. For some interesting models, the question of truth is decidable. These include
the theory of the real numbers <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb{R}, 0, 1, +, \times, &lt;)\)</span> with zero, one, addition,
multiplication, and the less-than relation,
and the theory of the integers <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb{Z}, 0, 1, +, &lt;)\)</span>
in the same language except without multiplication.</p>
<p>We can also ask about validity for restricted classes of formulas. A formula is said to be
<em>quantifier-free</em> if it has no quantifiers, and <em>universal</em> if it consists of any number
of universal quantifiers <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\forall\)</span> followed by a quantifier-free formula.
Interestingly, the question as to whether a universal first-order formula is valid is decidable.</p>
<p>Another thing we can do is ask whether a formula <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is provable from some axioms <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span>.
For some fixed choices of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span>, this question is decidable.
For example, there are natural axioms that characterize truth in the two
structures mentioned above, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb{R}, 0, 1, +, \times, &lt;)\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb{Z}, 0, 1, +, &lt;)\)</span>.</p>
<p>From the theoretical standpoint, before looking for a computational solution to a problem in logic,
the first challenge is to determine whether or not the problem
is decidable. If the answer is âyes,â we can look for implementations that
are efficient in practice. If the answer is âno,â the best we can do is look for simplifications
or approximations.
We will see that SMT solvers focus on the case where the answer is positive.
The goal of this chapter is to establish decidability in a few interesting cases,
without worrying about efficiency and implementation.</p>
<div class="section" id="linear-arithmetic">
<h2><span class="section-number">12.1. </span>Linear arithmetic<a class="headerlink" href="#linear-arithmetic" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>A <em>linear expression</em> is one of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a_1 x_2 + a_2 x_2 + \cdots + a_n x_n + b\)</span>,
where each <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a_i\)</span> is a rational number, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span> is a rational number,
and each <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_i\)</span> is a variable.
We think of the variables <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_i\)</span> as ranging over the real numbers.
A <em>linear constraint</em> is one of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s = t\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s &lt; t\)</span>, where
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> are linear expressions. (In practice, we usually include constraints
of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s \le t\)</span> and sometimes <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s \ne t\)</span> as well, but letâs keep it simple for now.)</p>
<p>Notice that any linear constraint is equivalent to one of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t = 0\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t &gt; 0\)</span>,
since we can move all the terms to one side. For example, the constraint <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3 x + 2 y &lt; 3y + 4z\)</span>
is equivalent to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-3x + y + 4z &gt; 0\)</span>.
An important observation that we will use below is that any linear constraint that involves
a variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> can be written as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x = t\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x &lt; t\)</span>, or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t &lt; x\)</span>,
where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> does not occur in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>.
We do this by simply solving for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>.
For example, the previous constraint can be expressed as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x &lt; (1/3)y + (4/3)z\)</span>.
Remember that dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative number reverses the direction.</p>
<p>A set <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span> of linear constraints is <em>satisfiable</em> if there is an assignment of real
values to the variables that makes them all true. Our first goal is to prove the following.</p>
<div class="admonition-theorem admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Theorem</p>
<p>The question as to whether a finite set of linear constraints is satisfiable is
decidable.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition-proof admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Proof</p>
<p>We use induction on the number of variables. If there are no variables at all,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span> contains only expressions of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b_0 &lt; b_1\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b_0 = b_1\)</span>
where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b_0\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b_1\)</span> are constants, and we only need to perform
the comparisons to see whether they are true. Remember that if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span>
is the empty set, we take it to be trivially satisfied.</p>
<p>In the inductive step, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span> contains a variable, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>.
If there is any equation involving <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span>, we put
it in the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x = t\)</span> and then substitute <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> everywhere.
The resulting set of constraints has one fewer variable, and clearly
it is equisatisfiable with the original one.
Given an assignment to the new set of constraints, we just assign <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>
the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<p>If there are no equations involving <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>, we can divide the constraints
in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span> intro three kinds:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>those that donât contain <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> at all</p></li>
<li><p>those that can be expressed in the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i &lt; x\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>those that can be expressed in the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x &lt; t_j\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma'\)</span> be the set that results from removing the inequalities
in the last two categories
and replacing them with inequalities of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i &lt; t_j\)</span>.
We claim <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma'\)</span> is equisatisfiable with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span>.
Clearly any assignment that satisfies <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span> also satisfies <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma'\)</span>.
Conversely, suppose <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span> is an assignment that satisfies <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma'\)</span>.
Then, under that assignment, the value of each <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i\)</span> is less than the value
of every <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_j\)</span>. We obtain an assignment satisfying <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span>
by mapping <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> to any value between the largest <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i\)</span> and the
smallest <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_j\)</span>. (If one of the last two categories is empty, we
remove the constraints in the other category entirely,
since they can be satisfied by taking <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> sufficiently large or sufficiently
small.)</p>
</div>
<p>The procedure implicit in this proof is known as the <em>Fourier-Motzkin</em> procedure, since
an incipient presentation of the idea can be found in the work of Jean-Baptiste Joseph
Fourier in the early nineteenth century. (This is the same Fourier who gave us Fourier
analysis.) In the worst case, every elimination step divides number the equations in half and
then squares it, resulting in doubly exponential behavior.
The procedure works well in practice, though, since in many applications each variable is
contained in only a few equations. (There are obvious heuristics, like choosing a variable
at each stage that minimizes the number of equations at the next stage.)
SMT solvers use much more efficient methods based on the simplex algorithm from linear programming.</p>
<p>What does this theorem have to do with logic?
Suppose the variables are labeled <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\)</span> and the
constraints are labeled <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_m\)</span>. Then what we are really asking as to whether
the formula <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ex {x_1, \ldots, x_n} c_1 \land c_2 \land \cdots \land c_m\)</span>
is true of the real numbers when the constraints are interpreted in the expected way.
To make this more precise, consider the structure <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb R, 0, 1, +, &lt;)\)</span>
in a language with symbols <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(+\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(&lt;\)</span>.
All the constraints can be expressed in this language, albeit in a clunky way. For example,
we can write <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3 x\)</span> as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x + x + x\)</span>, and express a constraint like <cite>x -(1/2)y + (4/3)z &lt; 0</cite>
as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(6x + 8z &lt; 3y\)</span>. A slight expansion of the proof of the theorem above yields the following:</p>
<div class="admonition-theorem admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Theorem</p>
<p>The question as to whether a sentence <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is true in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb R, 0, 1, +, &lt;)\)</span>
is decidable.</p>
</div>
<p>We will only sketch the details here.
The algorithm uses an important method known as âelimination of quantifiers.â
The idea is to successively eliminate quantifiers, one by one, until we are left with a
quantifier-free sentence. We can determine the truth of that by simply calculating.</p>
<p>We will show that any formula <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ex x A\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is quantifier-free,
is equivalent to a quantifier-free formula <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A'\)</span> that does not include <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>.
Repeating the process and using the fact that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\fa x A\)</span> is equivalent to
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lnot \ex x \lnot A\)</span>, we can eliminate all the quantifiers.</p>
<p>Given a formula <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ex x A\)</span>, put <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> into disjunctive normal form.
(We are not worrying about efficiency now, only trying to establish decidability in principle.)
We can replace <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s \not&lt; t\)</span> by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t &lt; s \lor s = t\)</span>, and we can replace
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s \ne t\)</span> by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s &lt; t \lor t &lt; s\)</span>.
Putting the result into disjunctive normal form again, we can assume that all the atomic
formulas are of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s &lt; t\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s = t\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we write <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_1 \lor A_2 \lor \cdots \lor A_n\)</span>, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ex x A\)</span>
is equivalent to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\ex x A_1) \lor (\ex x A_2) \lor \cdots \lor (\ex x A_n)\)</span>.
So we only need to show how to eliminate an existential quantifier from a conjunction
of constraints of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s &lt; t\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s = t\)</span>.
But that is exactly what the proof of the first theorem in this section does,
so we are done.</p>
<p>It is possible to write down axioms that justify every step of the transformation.
The resulting set of axioms is known as the theory of <em>linear arithmetic</em>.
The argument shows that the resulting set of axioms characterizes the structure exactly,
and that the question of provability from those axioms is decidable.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the theorem remains true if we add multiplication.
The resulting theory is known as the theory of <em>real closed fields</em>.
The proof is much harder, however. The theorem was proved by Alfred Tarski before World War II,
but it wasnât published until 1948, after the war.</p>

<div class="section" id="linear-integer-arithmetic">
<h2><span class="section-number">12.2. </span>Linear integer arithmetic<a class="headerlink" href="#linear-integer-arithmetic" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>What happens if we replace the real numbers by the integers? It turns out that
truth in the structure <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb Z, 0, 1, +)\)</span> is also decidable.
This was established in 1926 by MojÅ¼esz Presburger, a student of Tarskiâs,
who later died in the Holocaust. (The story has it that Tarski did not think
the result was enough for a dissertation, and made him do more work.)
The resulting theorem is known as <em>Presburger arithmetic</em> or <em>linear integer arithmetic</em>.
In contrast to the reals, the order on the integers is <em>discrete</em>, since
there is nothing between a value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x + 1\)</span>.
The decision procedure is more complicated than that for linear arithmetic,
and we will not discuss it here.
SMT solvers, however, use efficient implementations the <em>existential fragment</em>
of the theory, which is to say, the satisfiability problem for quantfier-free formulas.</p>
<p>In contrast to the case with the real numbers, however, the result is false if we
add multiplication.
In other words, truth in the model <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb Z, 0, 1, +, \times)\)</span> is undecidable.
This follows from the methods that GÃ¶del used to prove the incompleteness theorems,
and it is also a consequence of <em>Tarskiâs theorem</em> on the undefinability of truth.</p>
