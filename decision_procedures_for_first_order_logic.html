<p>Given a propositional formula <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and a truth assignment <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span>,
we have seen that it is straightforward to test wither <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is true under <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span>.
We have also seen that a formula <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is valid if and only if it is provable,
and we have considered decision procedures for propositional logic that determine whether
that is the case.</p>
<p>In a similar way, given a first-order sentence <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> and a model <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mdl M\)</span>,
we can ask whether <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is true in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mdl M\)</span>.
But for most fixed choices of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mdl M\)</span>, there is no algorithm to determine
whether or not <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is true. For example, there is no algorithm to determine whether
a sentence in a language with two binary function symbols is true of the model
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb{Z}, +, \times)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Given a first-order sentence <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span>, we can also ask whether it is valid,
that is, true in all models.
Once we have suitable proof systems for first-order logic, this will be equivalent
to the question as to whether <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is provable.
If the language has a binary relation symbol or two unary functions, this, too, is undecidable.</p>
<p>But all is not lost. For some interesting models, the question of truth is decidable. These include
the theory of the real numbers <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb{R}, 0, 1, +, \times, &lt;)\)</span> with zero, one, addition,
multiplication, and the less-than relation,
and the theory of the integers <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb{Z}, 0, 1, +, &lt;)\)</span>
in the same language except without multiplication.</p>
<p>We can also ask about validity for restricted classes of formulas. A formula is said to be
<em>quantifier-free</em> if it has no quantifiers, and <em>universal</em> if it consists of any number
of universal quantifiers <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\forall\)</span> followed by a quantifier-free formula.
Interestingly, the question as to whether a universal first-order formula is valid is decidable.</p>
<p>Another thing we can do is ask whether a formula <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is provable from some axioms <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span>.
For some fixed choices of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span>, this question is decidable.
For example, there are natural axioms that characterize truth in the two
structures mentioned above, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb{R}, 0, 1, +, \times, &lt;)\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb{Z}, 0, 1, +, &lt;)\)</span>.</p>
<p>From the theoretical standpoint, before looking for a computational solution to a problem in logic,
the first challenge is to determine whether or not the problem
is decidable. If the answer is “yes,” we can look for implementations that
are efficient in practice. If the answer is “no,” the best we can do is look for simplifications
or approximations.
We will see that SMT solvers focus on the case where the answer is positive.
The goal of this chapter is to establish decidability in a few interesting cases,
without worrying about efficiency and implementation.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">12.1. </span>Linear arithmetic<a class="headerlink" href="#linear-arithmetic" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>A <em>linear expression</em> is one of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \cdots + a_n x_n + b\)</span>,
where each <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a_i\)</span> is a rational number, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span> is a rational number,
and each <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_i\)</span> is a variable.
We think of the variables <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_i\)</span> as ranging over the real numbers.
A <em>linear constraint</em> is one of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s = t\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s &lt; t\)</span>, where
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> are linear expressions. (In practice, we usually include constraints
of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s \le t\)</span> and sometimes <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s \ne t\)</span> as well, but let’s keep it simple for now.)</p>
<p>Notice that any linear constraint is equivalent to one of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t = 0\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t &gt; 0\)</span>,
since we can move all the terms to one side. For example, the constraint <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3 x + 2 y &lt; 3y + 4z\)</span>
is equivalent to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-3x + y + 4z &gt; 0\)</span>.
An important observation that we will use below is that any linear constraint that involves
a variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> can be written as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x = t\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x &lt; t\)</span>, or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t &lt; x\)</span>,
where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> does not occur in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>.
We do this by simply solving for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>.
For example, the previous constraint can be expressed as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x &lt; (1/3)y + (4/3)z\)</span>.
Remember that dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative number reverses the direction.</p>
<p>A set <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span> of linear constraints is <em>satisfiable</em> if there is an assignment of real
values to the variables that makes them all true. Our first goal is to prove the following.</p>
<div class="admonition-theorem admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Theorem</p>
<p>The question as to whether a finite set of linear constraints is satisfiable is
decidable.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition-proof admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Proof</p>
<p>We use induction on the number of variables. If there are no variables at all,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span> contains only expressions of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b_0 &lt; b_1\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b_0 = b_1\)</span>
where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b_0\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b_1\)</span> are constants, and we only need to perform
the comparisons to see whether they are true. Remember that if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span>
is the empty set, we take it to be trivially satisfied.</p>
<p>In the inductive step, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span> contains a variable.
If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span> contains any false constant equations, it is unsatisfiable,
and it it contains any true constant equations, we can remove them without
affecting satisfiability.
If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span> contains a nontrivial equation with a variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>,
we put
it in the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x = t\)</span> and then substitute <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> everywhere.
The resulting set of constraints has one fewer variable, and clearly
it is equisatisfiable with the original one.
Given an assignment to the new set of constraints, we just assign <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>
the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<p>So we can now assume that there are no equations in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span>.
We can divide the inequalities in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span> intro three kinds:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>those that don’t contain <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> at all</p></li>
<li><p>those that can be expressed in the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i &lt; x\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>those that can be expressed in the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x &lt; t_j\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma'\)</span> be the set that results from removing the inequalities
in the last two categories
and replacing them with inequalities of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i &lt; t_j\)</span>.
We claim <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma'\)</span> is equisatisfiable with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span>.
Clearly any assignment that satisfies <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span> also satisfies <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma'\)</span>.
Conversely, suppose <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span> is an assignment that satisfies <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma'\)</span>.
Then, under that assignment, the value of each <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i\)</span> is less than the value
of every <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_j\)</span>. We obtain an assignment satisfying <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span>
by mapping <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> to any value between the largest <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i\)</span> and the
smallest <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_j\)</span>. (If one of the last two categories is empty, we
remove the constraints in the other category entirely,
since they can be satisfied by taking <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> sufficiently large or sufficiently
small.)</p>
</div>
<p>The procedure implicit in this proof is known as the <em>Fourier-Motzkin</em> procedure, since
an incipient presentation of the idea can be found in the work of Jean-Baptiste Joseph
Fourier in the early nineteenth century. (This is the same Fourier who gave us Fourier
analysis.) In the worst case, every elimination step divides the number of equations in half and
then squares it, resulting in doubly exponential behavior.
The procedure works well in practice, though, since in many applications each variable is
contained in only a few equations. (There are obvious heuristics, like choosing a variable
at each stage that minimizes the number of equations at the next stage.)
There is an implementation of the procedure in the file <cite>FourierMotzkin.lean</cite> in the <cite>Examples</cite>
folder,
modulo two components that we ask you to supply.
SMT solvers use much more efficient methods based on the simplex algorithm from linear programming.</p>
<p>What does this theorem have to do with logic?
Suppose the variables are labeled <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\)</span> and the
constraints are labeled <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_m\)</span>. Then what we are really asking as to whether
the formula <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ex {x_1, \ldots, x_n} c_1 \land c_2 \land \cdots \land c_m\)</span>
is true of the real numbers when the constraints are interpreted in the expected way.
To make this more precise, consider the structure <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb R, 0, 1, +, &lt;)\)</span>
in a language with symbols <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(+\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(&lt;\)</span>.
All the constraints can be expressed in this language, albeit in a clunky way. For example,
we can write <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3 x\)</span> as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x + x + x\)</span>, and express a constraint like <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x -(1/2)y + (4/3)z &lt; 0\)</span>
as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(6x + 8z &lt; 3y\)</span>. A slight expansion of the proof of the theorem above yields the following:</p>
<div class="admonition-theorem admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Theorem</p>
<p>The question as to whether a sentence <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is true in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb R, 0, 1, +, &lt;)\)</span>
is decidable.</p>
</div>
<p>We will only sketch the details here.
The algorithm uses an important method known as “elimination of quantifiers.”
The idea is to successively eliminate quantifiers, one by one, until we are left with a
quantifier-free sentence. We can determine the truth of that by simply calculating.</p>
<p>We will show that any formula <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ex x A\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is quantifier-free,
is equivalent to a quantifier-free formula <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A'\)</span> that does not include <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>.
Repeating the process and using the fact that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\fa x A\)</span> is equivalent to
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lnot \ex x \lnot A\)</span>, we can eliminate all the quantifiers.</p>
<p>Given a formula <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ex x A\)</span>, put <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> into disjunctive normal form.
(We are not worrying about efficiency now, only trying to establish decidability in principle.)
We can replace <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s \not&lt; t\)</span> by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t &lt; s \lor s = t\)</span>, and we can replace
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s \ne t\)</span> by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s &lt; t \lor t &lt; s\)</span>.
Putting the result into disjunctive normal form again, we can assume that all the atomic
formulas are of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s &lt; t\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s = t\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we write <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_1 \lor A_2 \lor \cdots \lor A_n\)</span>, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ex x A\)</span>
is equivalent to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\ex x A_1) \lor (\ex x A_2) \lor \cdots \lor (\ex x A_n)\)</span>.
So we only need to show how to eliminate an existential quantifier from a conjunction
of constraints of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s &lt; t\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s = t\)</span>.
But that is exactly what the proof of the first theorem in this section does,
so we are done.</p>
<p>It is possible to write down axioms that justify every step of the transformation.
The resulting set of axioms is known as the theory of <em>linear arithmetic</em>.
The argument shows that the resulting set of axioms characterizes the structure exactly,
and that the question of provability from those axioms is decidable.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the theorem remains true if we add multiplication.
The resulting theory is known as the theory of <em>real closed fields</em>.
The proof is much harder, however. The theorem was proved by Alfred Tarski before World War II,
but it wasn’t published until 1948, after the war.</p>
</section>
<section id="linear-integer-arithmetic">
<h2><span class="section-number">12.2. </span>Linear integer arithmetic<a class="headerlink" href="#linear-integer-arithmetic" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>What happens if we replace the real numbers by the integers? It turns out that
truth in the structure <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb Z, 0, 1, +)\)</span> is also decidable.
This was established in 1926 by Mojżesz Presburger, a student of Tarski’s,
who later died in the Holocaust. (The story has it that Tarski did not think
the result was enough for a dissertation, and made him do more work.)
The resulting theorem is known as <em>Presburger arithmetic</em> or <em>linear integer arithmetic</em>.
In contrast to the reals, the order on the integers is <em>discrete</em>, since
there is nothing between a value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x + 1\)</span>.
The decision procedure is more complicated than that for linear arithmetic,
and we will not discuss it here.
SMT solvers, however, use efficient implementations of the <em>existential fragment</em>
of the theory, which is to say, the satisfiability problem for quantifier-free formulas.</p>
<p>In contrast to the case with the real numbers, however, the result is false if we
add multiplication.
In other words, truth in the model <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb Z, 0, 1, +, \times)\)</span> is undecidable.
This follows from the methods that Gödel used to prove the incompleteness theorems,
and it is also a consequence of <em>Tarski’s theorem</em> on the undefinability of truth.</p>
</section>
<section id="equality">
<span id="section-equality"></span><h2><span class="section-number">12.3. </span>Equality<a class="headerlink" href="#equality" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Fix a language, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(L\)</span>. We will consider equations <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s = t\)</span> and <em>disequations</em>
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s \ne t\)</span> between closed terms.
The fact that we are considering closed terms mean that there are no variables to substitute
for; computer scientists sometimes call these <em>ground</em> terms.
(As with unification, in some contexts we may want to treat some variables as constant.
What is important here is not whether we call them variables or constants, but, rather,
the fact that we are not considering substitutions.)</p>
<p>The problem we are addressing here is this: given a set of equations and disequations, is
it satisfiable? Note that the word “satisfiable” is used in a different sense than it was
used in the previous two sections. In those sections, we are interested in whether a
set of formulas is satisfied by a variable assignment in a <em>particular</em>
model, namely, the reals and the integers, respectively. Here we are asking whether
a set of sentences is satisfied by any model.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following set of sentences:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(a, a) = b\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g(c, a) = c\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g(c, f(a, a)) = f(g(c, a), g(c, a))\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(c, c) \ne g(c, b)\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Is it satisfiable?</p>
<p>Before we answer that, let’s make some general observations. A set that only has equations and
no disequations is easily satisfiable, namely, in a model with a single element, where every
expression is equal to every other one. Similarly, a set that only has disequations is easily
satisfiable, unless one of the disequations is of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t \ne t\)</span>.
For that purpose, we can use the term model, where every term is interpreted as itself.
The interesting cases fall in between these two extremes, where the equations and disequations
balance one another.</p>
<p>Coming back to the question, the following considerations show that the answer is “no.”
Each of the following is a consequence of the equations above:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g(c, f(a, a)) = g(c, b)\)</span> from 1</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(g(c, a), g(c, a)) = f(c, c)\)</span> from 2</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(c, c) = g(c, b)\)</span> from 3, 5, and 6.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This contradicts the disequation 4 above. To understand what is going on, it is helpful
to think of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span> as addition, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(g\)</span> as multiplication, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span> as the number 1,
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span> as the number 2.
But the argument is fully abstract, and shows that the disequation cannot hold in any
model in which all the equations are satisfied.</p>
<p>These considerations encapsulate the main ideas behind the proof of the following theorem:</p>
<div class="admonition-theorem admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Theorem</p>
<p>The question as to whether a finite set of ground equations and disequations is satisfiable
is decidable.</p>
</div>
<p>The idea behind the proof is to use a <em>saturation</em> argument: starting from the equations in
question, we derive new equations until no more equations are derivable.
If we manage to contradict one of the disequations, the original set is not satisfiable.
In the case where no contradiction is found, we will argue that the original set is satisfiable.</p>
<p>To make all this precise, we need a set of rules for deriving equations.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{prooftree}
\AXC{$t = t$}
\end{prooftree}
\quad \quad
\begin{prooftree}
\AXC{$s = t$}
\UIC{$t = s$}
\end{prooftree}
\quad \quad
\begin{prooftree}
\AXC{$r = s$}
\AXC{$s = t$}
\BIC{$r = t$}
\end{prooftree}
\quad\quad
\begin{prooftree}
\AXC{$s_1 = t_1$}
\AXC{$\ldots$}
\AXC{$s_n = t_n$}
\TIC{$f(s_1, \ldots, s_n) = f(t_1, \ldots, t_n)$}
\end{prooftree}
\]</div></div></blockquote>
<p>The first three rules express the reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity of equality,
respectively.
The last rule is called the <em>congruence</em> rule.
You should convince yourself that using these rules we can derive</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{prooftree}
\AXC{$r = s$}
\UIC{$t[r/x] = t[s/x]$}
\end{prooftree}
\]</div></div></blockquote>
<p>for any terms <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> and variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>. If we add relation symbols
and atomic formulas, we would add the following rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[
\begin{prooftree}
\AXC{$s_1 = t_1$}
\AXC{$\ldots$}
\AXC{$s_n = t_n$}
\AXC{$R(s_1, \ldots, s_n)$}
\QuaternaryInfC{$R(t_1, \ldots, t_n)$}
\end{prooftree}
\]</div></div></blockquote>
<p>Returning to our proof plan, we want to show that if applying these rules successively
does not result in a contradiction, then there is a model in which the original equations
and disequations are all true.
But a problem arises: what if the original set contains an equation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a = f(a)\)</span>?
Then our algorithm falls into an infinite loop, deriving
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a = f(a) = f(f(a)) = f(f(f(a))) = \ldots\)</span>.
The solution is to restrict attention to <em>subterms</em> of terms appearing in the original
equations and disequations.
The theorem follows from the following lemma.</p>
<div class="admonition-lemma admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Lemma</p>
<p>Let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span> consist of a set of equations and disequations.
Let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> be the set of subterms of all the terms occurring in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span>.
Let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma'\)</span> be the set of al equations between elements of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span>
that can be derived from the equations in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span> using the rules above.
Then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span> is satisfiable if and only if no disequation in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span>
is the negation of an equation in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma'\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>The algorithm implicit in this lemma is called <em>congruence closure</em>.
We will see that it can be implemented efficiently (and <em>is</em> implemented efficiently in SMT
solvers) using <em>union-find</em> data structures.</p>
<div class="admonition-proof admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Proof</p>
<p>One direction of the lemma is easy. Since the equational rules preserve truth in any
model, if we can derive a contradiction from the equations and disequations in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span>,
then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span> is unsatisfiable. The other direction is harder.
Since there are only finitely many pairs of terms in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span>, the algorithm necessarily
terminates.
We need to show that if it terminates without deriving a contradiction, then there is a model
that satisfies <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span>.</p>
<p>Say two elements <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> are <em>equivalent</em>, written <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s \equiv t\)</span>,
if they are proved equal from the
equations in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span>. The rules guarantee that this is an <em>equivalence relation</em>, which is
to say, it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. It is also a <em>congruence</em>, which means that
applying a function symbol to equivalent terms results in equivalent terms.</p>
<p>To each element <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>, we associate its <em>equivalence class</em> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([t]\)</span>, defined by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[[t] = \{ s \in S \mid s \equiv t \}.\]</div>
<p>In words, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([t]\)</span> is the set of terms equivalent to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>.
Assuming the algorithm terminates without a contradiction, define a model <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mdl M\)</span>
whose universe consists of all the equivalence classes of elements of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span>
together with a new element, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\star\)</span>. For elements <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_1, \ldots t_n\)</span> in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span>,
interpret each <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span>-ary function symbol <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span> by function</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}f^{\mdl M}([t_1], \ldots, [t_n]) = \begin{cases}
  [f(t_1, \ldots, t_n)] &amp; \text{if $f(t_1, \ldots, t_n)$ is in $S$} \\
  \star &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>In other words, what <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f^{\mdl M}\)</span> does to each equivalence class is determined by what
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f\)</span> does to each of the elements.
The fact that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\equiv\)</span> is a congruence ensures that this makes sense.
This is just a truncated version of the term model, in which provably equal terms
are all glued together.</p>
<p>It is not hard to show that for every term <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span>,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tval{t}_{\mdl M}\)</span> is equal to  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([t]\)</span>.
But this is what we need. For every equation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s = t\)</span> in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> are in the
same equivalence class, so they are equal in the model.
And if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> are not provably equal, then <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([s]\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([t]\)</span> are not the same, so
every disequation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s \ne t\)</span> in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span> is true in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mdl M\)</span> as well.</p>
</div>
<p>For examples of the algorithm in action, first let us show that the set</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[f^3(a) = a, \, f^5(a) = a, \, f(a) \ne a\]</div>
<p>is unsatisfiable, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f^n(a)\)</span> abbreviates <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span>-fold application <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(f(\cdots f(a)))\)</span>.
The set of all subterms is</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[a, \, f(a), \, f^2(a), \, f^3(a), \, f^4(a), \, f^5(a).\]</div>
<p>We start with the equivalence classes <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{ a, f^3(a) \}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{ a, f^5(a)\}\)</span>
as well as all the others subterms in singleton sets.
From <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a = f^3(a)\)</span> we derive <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(a) = f^4(a)\)</span> by congruence, giving rise to the set
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{ f(a), f^4(a) \}\)</span>. Applying congruence again gives rise to the set <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{ f^2(a), f^5(a) \}\)</span>,
which is merged with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{ a, f^5(a)\}\)</span> to yield <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{ a, f^2(a), f^5(a) \}\)</span>.
Applying congruence again yields <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{ f(a), f^3(a) \}\)</span>. (We ignore the term <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f^6(a)\)</span>.)
This is merged with the set <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{ a, f^3(a) \}\)</span> to yield <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{ a, f(a), f^3(a)\}\)</span>.
Applying congruence again yields <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{ f(a), f^2(a), f^4(a)\}\)</span>, which is merged with
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{ a, f(a), f^3(a) \}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{ f^2(a), f^5(a) \}\)</span> to yield
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{ a, f(a), f^2(a), f^3(a), f^5(a) \}\)</span>.
At this point, we have derived <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(a) = a\)</span>, contradicting the disequality in the original set.
So the set is unsatisfiable.</p>
<p>Suppose we start instead with the set</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[f^2(a) = a, \, f^4(a) = a, \, f(a) \ne a, \, f(a) \ne b\]</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>You can check that in this case, the algorithm terminates with the following three
equivalence classes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([a] = \{ a, f^2(a), f^4(a)\}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([f(a)] = \{ f(a), f^3(a) \}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([b] = \{ b \}\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We now construct a model <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mdl M\)</span> with these elements and an additional element <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\star\)</span>, with</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}f^{\mdl M}([a]) &amp; = [f(a)] \\
f^{\mdl M}([f(a)]) &amp; = [a] \\
f^{\mdl M}([b]) &amp; = \star \\
f^{\mdl M}(\star) &amp; = \star\end{split}\]</div>
<p>You can check that this satisfies the original set of equations and disequations.</p>
<p>Suppose we allow atomic formulas <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R(t_1, \ldots, t_n)\)</span> and negated atomic formulas in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span>.
To test satisfiability, we do not have to change much.
Using the congruence rule for relations, whenever we have derived <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R(s_1, \ldots, s_n)\)</span>
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i = t_i\)</span> for every <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(i\)</span>, we can conclude <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R(t_1, \ldots, t_n)\)</span>.
The algorithm terminates when we contradict a disequality or another negated atomic formula.
If the algorithm terminates without a contradiction, we build a model as before,
where we simply declare that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R^{\mdl M}([t_1], \ldots, [t_n])\)</span> holds if and only if
we have determined that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R(t_1, \ldots, t_n)\)</span> in a consequence of the original set.</p>
<p>Now suppose we are given an existential sentence <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ex {x_1, \ldots, x_n} A\)</span>
where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is quantifier-free, and suppose we want to determine whether it is satisfiable.
Replace <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_1, \ldots, x_n\)</span> in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> with new constants <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c_1, \ldots, c_n\)</span>.
The resulting quantifier-free sentence is satisfiable if and only if the existential one is.
Put that sentence in DNF, and use the fact <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_1 \lor \cdots \lor A_n\)</span> is satisfiable
if and only if one of the sentences <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_i\)</span> is.
That reduces the task to determining whether a conjunction of literals is satisfiable,
and we have just explained how to do that.</p>
<p>Since a sentence is valid if and only if its negation is satisfiable, and since the negation
of a universal sentence is an existential sentence, we have shown the following.</p>
<div class="admonition-theorem admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Theorem</p>
<p>The satisfiability of an existential sentence in first-order logic is decidable.
Equivalently, the validity of a universal sentence is decidable.</p>
