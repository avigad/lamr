<p>In this chapter, we describe a decision procedure for the
satisfiability of quantifier-free formulas in the theory of linear equations and
inequalities in the real numbers. Finally, we will state some other important decidability and
undecidability results, to give you a fuller sense of the landscape.
In <a class="reference internal" href="using_smt_solvers.html#chapter-using-smt-solvers"><span class="std std-numref">Chapter 15</span></a>, we will consider SMT solvers,
whose main strength is that they are capable of combining decision procedures for the
quantifier-free parts of various theories and using them together effectively.</p>
<section id="linear-real-arithmetic">
<h2><span class="section-number">14.1. </span>Linear real arithmetic<a class="headerlink" href="#linear-real-arithmetic" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>We now turn from questions having to do with satisfiability and validity in arbitrary
models to questions about satisfiability in a particular model, namely, the real numbers.
A <em>linear expression</em> is one of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \cdots + a_n x_n + b\)</span>,
where each <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a_i\)</span> is a rational number, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span> is a rational number,
and each <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_i\)</span> is a variable.
We think of the variables <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_i\)</span> as ranging over the real numbers.
A <em>linear constraint</em> is one of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s = t\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s &lt; t\)</span>, where
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> are linear expressions. (In practice, we usually include constraints
of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s \le t\)</span> and sometimes <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s \ne t\)</span> as well. But the first can be
written <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s &lt; t\)</span> and the second can be written <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s &lt; t \lor t &lt; s\)</span>, so questions about
those can be rexpressed in terms of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(&lt;\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(=\)</span>, and focusing on those will simplify
the presentation below.)</p>
<p>Notice that any linear constraint is equivalent to one of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t = 0\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t &gt; 0\)</span>,
since we can move all the terms to one side. For example, the constraint <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3 x + 2 y &lt; 3y + 4z\)</span>
is equivalent to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(-3x + y + 4z &gt; 0\)</span>.
An important observation that we will use below is that any linear constraint that involves
a variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> can be written as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x = t\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x &lt; t\)</span>, or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t &lt; x\)</span>,
where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> does not occur in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>.
We do this by simply solving for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>.
For example, the previous constraint can be expressed as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x &lt; (1/3)y + (4/3)z\)</span>.
Remember that dividing both sides of an inequality by a negative number reverses the direction.</p>
<p>In this section we say that a set <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span> of linear constraints is <em>satisfiable</em> if and only
if there is an assignment of real
values to the variables that makes them all true. Our first goal is to prove the following.</p>
<div class="admonition-theorem admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Theorem</p>
<p>The question as to whether a finite set of linear constraints is satisfiable is
decidable.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition-proof admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Proof</p>
<p>We use induction on the number of variables. If there are no variables at all,
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span> contains only expressions of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b_0 &lt; b_1\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b_0 = b_1\)</span>
where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b_0\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b_1\)</span> are constants, and we only need to perform
the comparisons to see whether they are true. Remember that if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span>
is the empty set, we take it to be trivially satisfied.</p>
<p>In the inductive step, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span> contains a variable.
If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span> contains any false constant equations, it is unsatisfiable,
and it it contains any true constant equations, we can remove them without
affecting satisfiability.
If <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span> contains a nontrivial equation with a variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>,
we put
it in the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x = t\)</span> and then substitute <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> everywhere.
The resulting set of constraints has one fewer variable, and clearly
it is equisatisfiable with the original one.
Given an assignment to the new set of constraints, we just assign <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>
the value of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<p>So we can now assume that there are no equations in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span>.
We can divide the inequalities in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span> intro three kinds:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>those that don’t contain <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> at all</p></li>
<li><p>those that can be expressed in the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i &lt; x\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>those that can be expressed in the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x &lt; t_j\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma'\)</span> be the set that results from removing the inequalities
in the last two categories
and replacing them with inequalities of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i &lt; t_j\)</span>.
We claim <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma'\)</span> is equisatisfiable with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span>.
Clearly any assignment that satisfies <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span> also satisfies <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma'\)</span>.
Conversely, suppose <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma\)</span> is an assignment that satisfies <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma'\)</span>.
Then, under that assignment, the value of each <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i\)</span> is less than the value
of every <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_j\)</span>. We obtain an assignment satisfying <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Gamma\)</span>
by mapping <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> to any value between the largest <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_i\)</span> and the
smallest <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t_j\)</span>. (If one of the last two categories is empty, we
remove the constraints in the other category entirely,
since they can be satisfied by taking <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> sufficiently large or sufficiently
small.)</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">14.2. </span>Implementing Fourier-Motzkin<a class="headerlink" href="#implementing-fourier-motzkin" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The procedure implicit in this proof is known as the <em>Fourier-Motzkin</em> procedure.
The idea can be found in the work of Jean-Baptiste Joseph
Fourier in the early nineteenth century (the same Fourier who gave us Fourier
analysis), but it was rediscovered by multiple people in the nineteenth century, including Theo In the worst case, every elimination step divides the number of equations in half and
then squares it, resulting in doubly exponential behavior.
The procedure works well in practice, though, since in many applications each variable is
contained in only a few equations. (There are obvious heuristics, like choosing a variable
at each stage that minimizes the number of equations at the next stage.)
There is an implementation of the procedure in the file <cite>FourierMotzkin.lean</cite> in the <cite>Examples</cite>
folder,
modulo two components that we ask you to supply.
SMT solvers use much more efficient methods based on the simplex algorithm from linear programming.</p>
</section>
<section id="a-full-decision-procedure">
<h2><span class="section-number">14.3. </span>A full decision procedure<a class="headerlink" href="#a-full-decision-procedure" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>We can describe the Fourier-Motzkin procedure more explicitly as a decision procedure
for satisfiability of existential sentences in a langauge for the real numbers as follows.
Suppose we are given a problem in linear arithmetic where the variables are labeled
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\)</span> and the
constraints are labeled <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_m\)</span>. Then what we are really asking as to whether
the formula <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ex {x_1, \ldots, x_n} c_1 \land c_2 \land \cdots \land c_m\)</span>
is true of the real numbers when the constraints are interpreted in the expected way.
To make this more precise, consider the structure <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb R, 0, 1, +, &lt;)\)</span>
in a language with symbols <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(+\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(&lt;\)</span>.
All the constraints can be expressed in this language, albeit in a clunky way. For example,
we can write <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(3 x\)</span> as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x + x + x\)</span>, and express a constraint like <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x -(1/2)y + (4/3)z &lt; 0\)</span>
as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(6x + 8z &lt; 3y\)</span>. Alternatively, we can add symbols for scalar multiplication to the language.</p>
<p>We now obtain a decision procedure for arbitrary existential formulas
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ex {x_1, \ldots, x_n} A\)</span> as follows.
Given a formula <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ex x A\)</span>, put <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> into negation normal form, so that all the negations
are pushed down to atomic formulas.
Replace <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lnot (s &lt; t)\)</span> by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t &lt; s \lor s = t\)</span>, and we can replace
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s \ne t\)</span> by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s &lt; t \lor t &lt; s\)</span>.
(In practice, it is more efficient to include <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\le\)</span> in the language as well, and use the
fact that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lnot (s \le t)\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t &lt; s\)</span>.)
Putting the result into disjunctive normal form, we can assume that all the atomic
formulas are of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s &lt; t\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s = t\)</span>.
We can move the existential quantifiers through the disjunction as we did in <a class="reference internal" href="decision_procedures_for_equality.html#deciding-universal-sentences"><span class="std std-numref">Section 12.3</span></a> and then apply the Fourier-Motzkin procedure to
each disjunction.</p>
<p>In fact, a modification of the algorithm provides a decision procedure for the satisfiability
of <em>any</em> sentence in the language, not just the existential ones.</p>
<div class="admonition-theorem admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Theorem</p>
<p>The question as to whether a sentence <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is true in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb R, 0, 1, +, &lt;, \le)\)</span>
is decidable.</p>
</div>
<p>We will only sketch the details here.
The algorithm uses an important method known as “elimination of quantifiers.”
The idea is to successively eliminate quantifiers, one by one, until we are left with a
quantifier-free sentence. We can determine the truth of that by simply calculating.</p>
<p>We will show that any formula <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ex x A\)</span>, where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is quantifier-free,
is equivalent to a quantifier-free formula <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A'\)</span> that does not include <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>.
Repeating the process and using the fact that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\fa x A\)</span> is equivalent to
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lnot \ex x \lnot A\)</span>, we can eliminate all the quantifiers. We are then
left with a quantifier-free sentence, that is, a boolean combination of equations and
inequalities between closed terms. We can decide the truth of that sentence by evaluating
the terms.</p>
<p>We have already seen all the ideas. The procedure above allows us to write
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\ex x A\)</span> as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\ex x A_1) \lor (\ex x A_2) \lor \cdots \lor (\ex x A_n)\)</span>
where each <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A_i\)</span> is a conjunction of atomic formulas.
So we only need to show how to eliminate an existential quantifier from a conjunction
of constraints of the form <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s &lt; t\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s = t\)</span>.
But that is exactly what the pivot step in the Fourier-Motzkin procedure does, and we are done.</p>
<p>It is possible to write down axioms that justify every step of the transformation.
The resulting set of axioms is known as the theory of <em>linear arithmetic</em>.
The argument shows that the resulting set of axioms characterizes the structure exactly,
and that the question of provability from those axioms is decidable.</p>
<p>You should also notice that the justification of the procedure only used the fact basic
facts about arithmetic on the real numbers, as well as the fact we can find a real number
between any other two. So the procedure works just the same way, and returns the same answer,
for other structures that satisfy these properties, like the rationals.
In other words, the structure <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb Q, 0, 1, +, &lt;, \le)\)</span> has exactly the same
theory as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb R, 0, 1, +, &lt;, \le)\)</span>.</p>

<section id="linear-integer-arithmetic">
<h2><span class="section-number">14.4. </span>Linear integer arithmetic<a class="headerlink" href="#linear-integer-arithmetic" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Returning to the language without multiplication, one can ask what happens if we replace
the real numbers by the integers.
In other words, we can ask whether the truth of sentences in the structure
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb Z, 0, 1, +, &lt;)\)</span> is decidable.
In contrast to the reals, the order on the integers is <em>discrete</em>, since
there is nothing between a value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x + 1\)</span>.
The problem is nonetheless decidable.
The result was first proved  in 1926 by Mojżesz Presburger, a student of Tarski’s,
who later died in the Holocaust. The story has it that Tarski did not think
the result was enough for a dissertation, and made him do more work.
The resulting theory is known as <em>Presburger arithmetic</em> or <em>linear integer arithmetic</em>.</p>
<p>The decision procedure is more complicated than that for linear arithmetic,
and we will not discuss it here.
SMT solvers, however, use efficient implementations of the <em>existential fragment</em>
of the theory, which is to say, the satisfiability problem for quantifier-free formulas.</p>
</section>
<section id="other-theories">
<h2><span class="section-number">14.5. </span>Other theories<a class="headerlink" href="#other-theories" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>What happens if we extend linear real arithmetic by adding multiplication between
arbitrary terms? Formally, we are asking about the theory of the real numbers
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb{R}, 0, 1, +, \times, &lt;)\)</span> with zero, one, addition,
multiplication, and the less-than relation. It is equivalent to extending
linear arithmetic by allowing atomic formulas <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p = 0\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p &gt; 0\)</span> where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> is
an arbitrary polynomial. The theory, known also as the theory of <em>Real closed
fields</em>, is still decidable. The theorem was proved by Alfred Tarski before World War II,
but it wasn’t published until 1948, after the war.</p>
<p>What happens if we add multiplication to linear integer arithmetic?
In contrast to the case with the real numbers, the theory of the integers
with addition and multiplication is undecidable.
In other words, there is no algorithm to decide truth in the model
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\mathbb Z, 0, 1, +, \times)\)</span>.
This follows from the methods that Gödel used to prove the incompleteness theorems,
and it is also a consequence of <em>Tarski’s theorem</em> on the undefinability of truth.
The phenomena can be stated in very strong terms: no theory or structure in which one
can interpret a small amount of arithmetic with addition and multiplication is decidable.</p>
