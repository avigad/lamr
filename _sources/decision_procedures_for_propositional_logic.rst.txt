Decision Procedures for Propositional Logic
===========================================

We have seen that it is possible to determine whether or not a propositional formula is valid
by writing out its entire truth table.
This seems pretty inefficient; if a formula :math:`A` has :math:`n` variables,
the truth table has :math:`2^n` lines, and hence checking it requires at least that many lines.
It is still an open question, however, whether one can do substantially better.
If :math:`P \ne NP`, there is no polynomial algorithm to determine satisfiability (and hence
validity.)

Nonetheless, there are procedures that seem to work better in practice.
In fact, we can generally do *much* better in practice.
In the next chapter, we will discuss *SAT solvers*, which are pieces of software that are
are remarkably good at determining whether a propositional formula has a satisfying assignment.

Before 1990, most solvers allowed arbitrary propositional formulas as input.
Most contemporary SAT solvers, however, are designed to determine the satisfiability of formulas in
conjunctive normal form.
:numref:`section_normal_forms` shows that, in principle, this does not sacrifice generality,
because any propositional formula :math:`A` can be transformed to
an equivalent CNF formula :math:`B`.
The problem is that, in general, however, the smallest such :math:`B` may be
exponentially longer than :math:`A`,
which makes the transformation impractical.
(See the exercises at the end of :numref:`Chapter %s<chapter_propositional_logic>`.)
In the next section, we will show you an efficient method for associating
a list of clauses to :math:`A` with the property that :math:`A`
is satisfiable if and only if the list of clauses is.
With this transformation, solvers can be used to test the
satisfiability of any propositional formula.

It's easy to get confused. Remember that most formulas are neither
valid nor unsatisfiable.
In other words, most formulas are true for some
assignments and false for others. So testing for validity and
testing for satisfiability are two different things, and
it is important to keep the distinction clear.
But there is an important relationship between the two notions:
a formula :math:`A` is valid if and only if :math:`\lnot A`
is unsatisfiable.
This provides a recipe for determining the validity of :math:`A`,
namely, use a SAT solver to determine whether :math:`\lnot A`
is satisfiable, and then change a "yes" answer to a "no" and vice-versa.


.. _section_the_tseitin_transformation:

The Tseitin transformation
--------------------------

We have seen that if :math:`A` is a propositional formula, the smallest CNF equivalent
may be exponentially longer.
The Tseitin transformation provides an elegant workaround:
instead of looking for an *equivalent* formula :math:`B`, we look for one
that is *equisatisfiable*, which is to say, one that is satisfiable if and only if :math:`A` is.
For example, instead of distributing :math:`p` across the conjunction in
:math:`p \lor (q \land r)`,
we can introduce a new definition :math:`d` for :math:`q \land r`.
We can express the equivalence :math:`d \liff (q \land r)` in conjunctive normal form as

.. math::

    (\lnot d \lor q) \land (\lnot d \lor r) \land (\lnot q \lor \lnot r \lor d).

Assuming that equivalence holds, the original formula :math:`p \lor (q \land r)` is
equivalent to :math:`p \lor d`, which we can add to the conjunction above,
to yield a CNF formula.

The resulting CNF formula implies :math:`p \lor (q \land r)`, but not the other way
around: :math:`p \lor (q \land r)` does not imply :math:`d \liff (q \land r)`.
But the resulting formulas is equisatisfiable with the original one:
given any truth assignment to the original one,
we can give :math:`d` the truth value of :math:`q \land r`, and, conversely,
for any truth assignment satisfying the resulting CNF formula, :math:`d` *has* to have that value.
So determining whether or not the resulting CNF formula is satisfiable is tantamount to determining
whether the original one is.
This may seem to be a roundabout translation, but the point is that the number
of definitions is bounded by the length of the original formula
and the size of the CNF representation of each definition is bounded by a constant.
So the length of the resulting formula is linear in the length of the original one.

The following code, found in the `LAMR` library in the `NnfForm` namespace,
runs through a formula in
negation normal form and produces a list of definitions `def_0`, `def_1`, `def_2`, and so on,
each of which represents a conjunction or disjunction of
two variables.
We assume that none these `def` variables are found in the original formula.
(A more sophisticated implementation would check the original formula and start the
numbering high enough to avoid a clash.)

.. literalinclude:: ../../LAMR/Examples/using_sat_solvers/tseitin.lean
  :start-after: -- textbook: mkDefs
  :end-before: -- end: mkDefs

The keyword `where` is used to define an auxiliary function that is not
meant to be used anywhere else.
The function `mkDefs` takes an NNF formula and a list of definitions,
and it returns an augmented list of definitions and a literal
representing the original formula.
More precisely, the list `defs` is an array of disjunctions and conjunctions
of variables,
where the first one corresponds to `def_0`, the next one corresponds to `def_1`,
and so on.
In the cases where the original formula is a conjunction or a disjunction,
the function first recursively creates definitions for the
component formulas and then adds a new definition for the original formula.
The auxiliary function `add_def` first checks to see whether
the formula to be added is already found in the array.
For example, when passed a conjunction `p ∧ def_0`,
if that formula is already in the list of definitions in position 7,
`add_def` returns `def_7` as the definition of the formula and leaves the array
unchanged.

To illustrate, we start by putting the formula

.. math::

  \lnot (p \land q \liff r) \land (s \limplies p \land t)

in negation normal form.

.. literalinclude:: ../../LAMR/Examples/using_sat_solvers/tseitin.lean
  :start-after: -- textbook: ex1
  :end-before: -- end: ex1

Removing extraneous parentheses, we get

.. math::

    ((p \land q \land \lnot r) \lor (r \land (\lnot p \lor \lnot q)) \land
    (\lnot s \lor (p \land t)).

In the following, we compute the list of definitions corresponding
to `ex1`, and then we use a little program to print them out in a more
pleasant form.

.. literalinclude:: ../../LAMR/Examples/using_sat_solvers/tseitin.lean
  :start-after: -- textbook: ex1 defs
  :end-before: -- end: ex1 defs

We can obtain an equisatisfiable version of the formula by putting
all the definitions into conjunctive normal form, collecting them all
together, and adding one more conjunct with the variable `d` corresponding
to the definition of the top level formula. There is a constant bound
on the size of each CNF definition, which corresponds to a single conjunction
or disjunction. (This would still be true if we added other binary connectives,
like a bi-implication.) Since the number of definitions is linear in the
size of the original formula, the size of the equisatisfiable CNF formula
is linear in the original one.

There is an important optimization of the Tseitin transformation due to
Plaisted and Greenbaum, who observed that for equisatisfiability,
only one direction of the implication is needed for each subformula.
If we start with a formula in negation normal form,
each subformula occurs *positively*, which means that switching its truth
value from negative to positive can only change the truth value of the entire
formula in the same direction. In that case, only the forward direction
of the implication is needed. For example, the formula :math:`(p \land q) \lor r`
is equisatisfiable with :math:`(d \lor r) \land (d \to p \land q)`, which
can be expressed in CNF as :math:`(d \lor r) \land (\lnot d \lor p) \land (\lnot d \lor q)`.
To see that they are equisatisfiable, notice that any satisfying assignment to
:math:`(p \land q) \lor r` can be extended to a satisfying assignment of
:math:`(d \lor r) \land (d \limplies p \land q)` by giving :math:`d` the same truth assignment
as :math:`p \land q`, and, conversely, :math:`(d \lor r) \land (d \limplies p \land q)`
entails :math:`(p \land q) \lor r`.

It isn't hard to put a implication of the form :math:`(A \limplies B)` into
conjunctive normal form. The LAMR library defines a function to do that,
and another one that turns the entire list of definitions returned by
`mkDefs` into a single CNF formula.

.. literalinclude:: ../../LAMR/Examples/using_sat_solvers/tseitin.lean
  :start-after: -- textbook: implToCnf
  :end-before: -- end: implToCnf

If we take the resulting formula and add a conjunct for the
variable representing the top level, we have an equisatisfiable CNF formula,
as desired.

A moment's reflection shows that we can do better. For example, if
the formula :math:`A` is already in CNF, we don't have to introduce
any definitions at all. The following functions from the library
do their best to interpret an NNF formula as a CNF formula,
introducing definitions only when necessary. The first function,
`NnfForm.orToCnf`, interprets a formula as a clause.
For example, given the formula :math:`p \lor (q \land \lnot r) \lor \lnot s`
and a list of definitions, it adds a definition :math:`d` for :math:`q \land \lnot r` and
returns the clause :math:`p \lor d \lor \lnot s`.
The function `NnfForm.andToCnf` does the analogous thing for conjunctions,
and the function `NnfForm.toCnf` puts it all together.

.. literalinclude:: ../../LAMR/Examples/using_sat_solvers/tseitin.lean
  :start-after: -- textbook: toCnf
  :end-before: -- end: toCnf

The following example tests it out on `ex1.toCnf`.
The comment afterward shows the resulting CNF formula
and then reconstructs the definitions to show that the result is equivalent
to the original formula.

.. literalinclude:: ../../LAMR/Examples/using_sat_solvers/tseitin.lean
  :start-after: -- textbook: ex1.toCnf
  :end-before: -- end: ex1.toCnf

There is one additional optimization that we have not implemented in the library:
we can be more efficient with iterated conjunctions and disjunctions.
For example, you can check that :math:`d \limplies \ell_1 \land \cdots \land \ell_n`
can be represented by the conjunction of the clauses :math:`\lnot d \lor \ell_1` to
:math:`\lnot d \lor \ell_n`, and :math:`d \limplies \ell_1 \lor \cdots \lor \ell_n`
can be represented by the single clause :math:`\lnot d \lor \ell_1 \lor \cdots \lor \ell_n`.

.. _section_unit_propagation_and_the_pure_literal_rule:

Unit propagation and the pure literal rule
------------------------------------------

In earlier chapters, we considered only truth assignments that assign a truth value to all propositional
variables. However, complete search methods for SAT like DPLL use *partial assignments*, which assign truth
values to some subset of the variables. For a clause :math:`C` and partial truth assignment :math:`\tau`,
we denote by :math:`\tval{C}_\tau` the reduced clause constructed by removing falsified literals. If
:math:`\tau` satisfies a literal in :math:`C`, we interpret :math:`\tval{C}_\tau` as the
singleton clause consisting of :math:`\top`,
while if :math:`\tau` falsifies all literals in :math:`C`, then :math:`\tval{C}_\tau` is the empty clause, which we take to represent :math:`\bot`. For a CNF formula :math:`\Gamma`,
we denote by :math:`\tval{\Gamma}_\tau` the conjunction of :math:`\tval{C}_\tau` with :math:`C \in \Gamma`,
where we throw away the clauses :math:`C` such that :math:`\tval{C}_\tau` is :math:`\top`.
Remember that if :math:`\tval{\Gamma}_\tau` is an empty conjunction,
we interpret it as being true. In other words, we identify the empty conjunction with :math:`\top`.
On the other hand, if :math:`\tval{\Gamma}_\tau` contains an empty clause, then :math:`\tval{\Gamma}`
is equivalent to :math:`\bot`.

Notice that we are reusing the notation :math:`\tval{A}_\tau` that we introduced
in :numref:`section_semantics_propositional_logic` to describe the evaluation of a formula :math:`A` under a truth assignment :math:`\tau`.
This is an abuse of notation, because in that section we were interpreting :math:`\tval{A}_\tau`
as a *truth value*, whereas now we are taking :math:`\tval{C}_\tau` to be a *clause*
and we are taking :math:`\tval{\Gamma}_\tau` to be *CNF formula*.
But the abuse is harmless, and, indeed, quite helpful.
Notice that if :math:`\tau` is a partial truth assignment that assigns values to
all the variables in a clause :math:`C`, then :math:`\tval{C}_\tau` evaluates to either the empty
clause or :math:`\top`,
and if :math:`\tau` is a partial truth assignment that assigns values to
all the variables in a CNF formula :math:`\Gamma`,
then :math:`\tval{\Gamma}_\tau` evaluates to either the empty CNF formula, :math:`\top`,
or the singleton conjunction of the empty clause, which is our CNF representation of :math:`\bot`.
In that sense, the notation we are using in this chapter is a generalization of the
notation we used to describe the semantics of propositional logic.

Remember also that if :math:`\tau` is a truth assignment in the sense of :numref:`section_semantics_propositional_logic`,
the semantic evaluation :math:`\tval{A}_\tau` only depends on the values of :math:`\tau`
that are assigned to variables that occur in :math:`\tval{A}`.
In this chapter, when we say "truth assignment," we will generally mean "partial truth assignment,"
and the analogous fact holds: the values of :math:`\tval{C}_\tau` and :math:`\tval{\Gamma}_\tau`
depend only on the variables found in :math:`C` and :math:`\Gamma`, respectively.
In particular, if :math:`\tau` is a satisfying assignment for :math:`C`,
we can assume without loss of generality that :math:`\tau` assigns values only to the variables
that occur in :math:`C`, and similarly for :math:`\Gamma`.

A key SAT-solving technique is *unit propagation*. Given a CNF formula :math:`\Gamma` and a truth assignment
:math:`\tau`, a clause :math:`C \in \Gamma` is *unit under* :math:`\tau` if :math:`\tau` falsifies all but one literal of
:math:`C` and the remaining literal is unassigned. In other words, :math:`C` is unit under :math:`\tau` if :math:`\tval{C}_\tau` consists of a single literal. The only way to satisfy
:math:`C` is to assign that literal to true. Unit propagation iteratively extends :math:`\tau` by satisfying all unit clauses. This process
continues until either no new unit clauses are generated by the extended :math:`\tau` or until the extended :math:`\tau`
falsifies a clause in :math:`\Gamma`.

For example, consider the partial truth assignment :math:`\tau` with :math:`\tau(p_1) = \top` and the following formula:

.. math::

  \Gamma_\mathrm{unit} :=  (\lnot p_1 \lor \lnot p_3 \lor p_4) \land
        (\lnot p_1 \lor \lnot p_2 \lor p_3) \land (\lnot p_1 \lor p_2) \land (p_1 \lor p_3 \lor p_6) \land \\
    (\lnot p_1 \lor p_4 \lor \lnot p_5) \land (p_1 \lnot p_6) \land (p_4 \lor p_5 \lor p_6) \land (p_5 \lor \lnot p_6)

The clause :math:`(\lnot p_1 \lor p_2)` is unit under :math:`\tau` because :math:`\tval{(\lnot p_1 \lor p_2)}_{\tau} = (p_2)`.
Hence unit propagation will extend :math:`\tau` by
assigning :math:`p_2` to :math:`\top`. Under the extended :math:`\tau`, :math:`(\lnot p_1 \lor \lnot p_2 \lor p_3)`
is unit, which will further extend  :math:`\tau` by assigning :math:`p_3` to :math:`\top`. Now the
clause :math:`(\lnot p_1 \lor \lnot p_3 \lor p_4)` becomes unit and thus assigns :math:`p_4` to :math:`\top`.
Ultimately, no unit clauses remain and unit propagation terminates with :math:`\tau(p_1) = \tau(p_2) = \tau(p_3) = \tau(p_4) = \top`.

Another important simplification technique is the *pure literal rule*. A literal :math:`l` is called pure in a formula :math:`\Gamma` if no
clause in :math:`\Gamma` contains the literal :math:`\lnot l`. The pure literal rule sets pure literals to :math:`\top`.

In contrast to unit propagation, the pure literal rule can reduce the number of satisfying assignments. Consider for
example for the formula :math:`\Gamma = (p \lor q) \land (\lnot q \lor r) \land (q \lor \lnot r)`. The literal :math:`p` is pure,
so the pure literal rule will assign it to :math:`\tau(p) = \top`. We leave it to you to check that :math:`\Gamma` has
three satisfying assignments, while :math:`\tval{\Gamma}_{\tau}` has only two satisfying assignments.

.. _section_dpll:

DPLL
--------------

One of the first and most well-known decision procedures for SAT problems is the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland
(DPLL) algorithm, which was invented by Davis, Logemann, and Loveland in 1962,
based on
earlier work by Davis and Putnam in 1960. DPLL is a complete, backtracking-based search algorithm
that builds a binary tree of truth assignments. For nearly four decades since its invention, almost all
complete SAT solvers have been based on DPLL.

The DPLL procedure is a recursive algorithm that takes a CNF formula :math:`\Gamma` and a truth assignment :math:`\tau`
as input and returns a Boolean indicating whether :math:`\Gamma` under the assignment :math:`\tau` can be satisfied.
Each recursive call starts by extending :math:`\tau` using unit propagation and the pure literal rule.
Afterwards, it checks whether the formula is satisfiable (:math:`\tval{\Gamma}_\tau = \top`) or unsatisfiable (:math:`\tval{\Gamma}_\tau = \bot`).
In either of those cases it returns :math:`\top` or :math:`\bot`, respectively. Otherwise, it selects an unassigned propositional variable :math:`p`
and recursively calls DPLL with one branch extending :math:`\tau` with :math:`\tau(p) = \top` and another branch
extending :math:`\tau` with :math:`\tau(p) = \bot`. If one of the calls returns :math:`\top` it returns :math:`\top`, otherwise it
returns :math:`\bot`.

The effectiveness of DPLL depends strongly on the quality of the propositional variables that are selected for the
recursive calls. The propositional variable selected for a recursive call is called a *decision variable*. A simple but
effective heuristic is to pick the variable that occurs most frequently in the
shortest clauses. This heuristics is called *MOMS* (Maximum Occurrence in clauses of Minimum Size). More
expensive heuristics are based on *lookaheads*, that is, assigning a variable to a truth value and measuring how much the formula can be simplified as a result.

Consider the following CNF formula:

.. math::

  \Gamma_\mathrm{DPLL} :=  (p_1 \lor p_2 \lor \lnot p_3) \land (\lnot p_1 \lor p_2 \lor p_3) \land (\lnot p_1 \lor \lnot p_2 \lor p_3) \land (p_1 \lor p_3) \land (\lnot p_1 \lor \lnot p_3)

Selecting :math:`p_3` as decision variable in the root node, results in a DPLL tree with two leaf nodes. However, when selecting :math:`p_2` as decision variable in the root node,
the DPLL tree consists of four leaf nodes. The figure below shows the DPLL trees with green nodes denoting satisfying assignments, while black nodes denote falsifying assignments.

  .. image:: ../figures/dpll.*
   :height: 150 px
   :alt: dpll example
   :align: center

We have implemented a basic version of the DPLL procedure in Lean,
which can be found in the `Examples` folder.
We will start at the top level and work our way down.
The function `dpllSat` accepts a CNF formula and returns either a satisfying
assignment or `none` if there aren't any.
It calls `propagateUnits` to perform unit propagation,
and then calls `dpllSatAux` to iteratively pick an unassigned variable
and split on that variable.
We use the keyword `partial` to allow for an arbitrary recursive call.

.. literalinclude:: ../../LAMR/Examples/using_sat_solvers/dpll.lean
  :start-after: -- textbook: dpllSat
  :end-before: -- end: dpllSat

The function `pickSplit?` naively chooses the first variable it finds.
It follows the Lean convention of using a question mark for a function that
returns an element of an option type.

.. literalinclude:: ../../LAMR/Examples/using_sat_solvers/dpll.lean
  :start-after: -- textbook: pickSplit?
  :end-before: -- end: pickSplit?

The function `propagateUnits` performs unit propagation and returns the resulting
formula and the augmented truth assignment.
As long as there is a unit clause, it simplifies the formula and adds the new
literal to the assignment.

.. literalinclude:: ../../LAMR/Examples/using_sat_solvers/dpll.lean
  :start-after: -- textbook: propagateUnits
  :end-before: -- end: propagateUnits

The function `propagateWithNew` is used to peform a split on the literal `x`.
It assigns the value of `x` and then does unit propagation.

.. literalinclude:: ../../LAMR/Examples/using_sat_solvers/dpll.lean
  :start-after: -- textbook: propagateWithNew
  :end-before: -- end: propagateWithNew

Finally, the function `simplify` simplifies a CNF formula by assigning the literal `x`
to true, assuming `x` is not one of the constants `⊥` or `⊤`.

  :end-before: -- end: simplify


.. _section_autarkies_and_2_sat:

Autarkies and 2-SAT
-------------------

Unit propagation and the pure literal rule form the core of the DPLL algorithm.
In this section, we present a generalization of the pure literal rule,
and we illustrate its use by providing an efficient algorithm for a restricted version of SAT.

The notion of an *autarky* or *autarky assignment* is a generalization of
the notion of a pure literal. An autarky for a set of clauses is an assignment that satisfies all
the clauses that are touched by the assignment, in other words,
all the clauses that have at least one literal assigned.
A satisfying assignment of a set of clauses is one example of an autarky.
The assignment given by the pure literal rule is another.
There are often more interesting autarkies that are somewhere in between the two.

Notice that if :math:`\tau` is an autarky for :math:`\Gamma`,
then :math:`\tval{\Gamma}_\tau \subseteq \Gamma`.
To see this, suppose :math:`C` is any clause in :math:`\Gamma`.
If :math:`C` is touched by :math:`\tau`, then :math:`\tval{C}_\tau = \top`,
and so it is removed from :math:`\tval{\Gamma}_\tau`.
If :math:`C` is not touched by :math:`\tau`, then :math:`\tval{C}_\tau = C`.
Since every element of :math:`\tval{\Gamma}_\tau` is of one of these two forms,
we have that :math:`\tval{\Gamma}_\tau \subseteq \Gamma`.

.. admonition:: Theorem

    Let :math:`\tau` be an autarky for formula :math:`\Gamma`. Then
    :math:`\Gamma` and :math:`\tval{\Gamma}_\tau` are satisfiability equivalent.

.. admonition:: Proof

    If :math:`\Gamma` is satisfiable, then since :math:`\tval{\Gamma}_\tau \subseteq \Gamma`,
    we know that :math:`\tval{\Gamma}_\tau` is satisfiable as well.
    Conversely, suppose :math:`\tval{\Gamma}_\tau` is satisfiable
    and let :math:`\tau_1` be an assignment that satisfies :math:`\tval{\Gamma}_\tau`.
    We can assume that :math:`\tau_1` only assigns values to the variables of
    :math:`\tval{\Gamma}_\tau`, which are distinct from the variables of :math:`\tau`.
    Then the assignment :math:`\tau_2` which is the union of :math:`\tau` and :math:`\tau_1`
    satisfies :math:`\Gamma`.

We now turn to a restricted version of SAT.
A CNF formula is called :math:`k`-SAT if the length of all clauses is at most :math:`k`.
2-SAT formulas can be solved in polynomial time, while :math:`k`-SAT is NP-complete
for :math:`k \geq 3`. A simple, efficient
decision procedure for 2-SAT uses only unit propagation and autarky reasoning. The decision procedure is based
on the following observation. Given a 2-SAT formula :math:`\Gamma` that contains a propositional
variable :math:`p`, unit propagation on :math:`\Gamma` using :math:`\tau(p) = \top` has two possible
outcomes: (1) it results in a conflict, meaning that all satisfying assignments of :math:`\Gamma`
have to assign :math:`p` to :math:`\bot`, or (2) unit propagation does not result in a conflict, in which case the
extended assignment after unit propagation is an autarky. To understand the latter case, note that
assigning a literal in any clause of length two either satisfies the clause (if the literal is true) or
reduces it to a unit clause (if the literal is false). So if there isn't a conflict, then it is impossible
that unit propagation will produce a clause that is touched but not satisfied.

The decision procedure works as follows. Given a 2-SAT formula :math:`\Gamma`, we pick
a propositional variable :math:`p` occurring in :math:`\Gamma` and compute the result
of unit propagation on :math:`\Gamma` using :math:`\tau(p) = \top`. If unit propagation
does not result in a conflict, let :math:`\tau'` be the extended assignment and we continue
with :math:`\tval{\Gamma}_{\tau'}`. Otherwise let :math:`\tau''(p) = \bot` and we continue with
:math:`\tval{\Gamma}_{\tau''}`. This process is repeated until the formula is empty,
which indicates that the original formula is satisfiable,
or contains the empty clause,
which indicates that the original clause is unsatisfiable.


.. _section_cdcl:

CDCL
----

The Conflict-Driven Clause-Learning (CDCL) decision procedure is the most successful SAT solving
paradigm. Although it evolved from DPLL, modern implementations of CDCL have hardly any resemblance
with the classic decision procedure. The algorithms differ in core algorithmic choices.
When designing an algorithm, one typically needs to choose between making the algorithm smart or
making it fast. Having it both ways is generally not an option due to conflicting requirements for the datastructures.
State-of-the-art DPLL algorithms are designed to be smart: spend serious computational effort to
pick the best variable in each recursive call to make the binary tree relatively small. As we will describe below,
CDCL focuses on being fast. Unit propagation is by far the most computationally expensive step
and everything in a CDCL solver is designed by make that as fast as possible. That prevents
more complicated heuristics. Another important design decision for SAT solving algorithms is
determining whether you plan to find a satisfying assignment or prove that none exists. DPLL
focuses on finding a satisfying assignment by picking the most satisfiable branch first, while
CDCL, as the name suggests, prefers conflicts and wants to find a short refutation. A
satisfying assignment is a counterexample to no refutation exists.

The early development of CDCL is four decades later than DPLL. While DPLL simply backtracks
when a conflict (leaf node) is reached, CDCL turns this conflict into a conflict clause that is
added to the formula. The first and arguably most important step towards CDCL is the invention
which clause to add: the first unique implication point. The first unique implication point is an
invention by Marques-Silva and Sakallah (1996) and is still used in all modern day top-tier
solvers.

The best decision heuristic for CDCL selects the unassigned variable that occurs
most frequently in recently learned conflict clauses. This heuristic, called
Variable-State Independent Decaying Sum (VSIDS in short), was introduced
in the zChaff SAT solver by Moskewicz and co-authors (2001). The heuristic
was been improved over the years, in particular by E\'en and S\"orensson (2003)
in their solver MiniSAT. In recent years some other advances have been made as well.
However, selecting variables in recent conflict clauses is still the foundation.

Adding clauses to the input formula could significantly increase the cost of unit propagation.
Therefore clause learning was not immediately successful. The contribution that showed the
effectiveness of clause learning in practice is the 2-literal watchpointers datastructure.
In short, the solver does not maintain a full occurrence list of clauses, but only an
occurrence list of the first two literals in a clause. These first two literals are required to
have the following invariant: either both literals are unassigned or one of them is
assigned to true. That invariant is enough to ensure that the clause is not unit. In case
an assignment breaks the invariant, then the entire clause is explored to check whether
it is possible to fix the invariant by swapping a satisfied or unassigned literal to the first
two positions. If this is not possible, the clause is unit and the unassigned literal
is assigned to true or the clause is falsified which triggers the learning procedure in
the solver.

Another key difference between CDCL and DPLL is that the former restarts very
frequently. Restarting sounds drastic, but simply means that all variables are
unassigned. The remainder of the solver state, such as the heuristics and the
learned clauses, are not altered. Modern SAT solver restart often: say roughly
a thousand times per second (although this depends on the size of the formula).
As a consequence, no binary search tree is constructed. Instead, CDCL might
be best viewed a conflict-clause generator without any systematic search.

The are various other parts in CDCL solvers that are important for fast
performance but that are beyond the scope of this course. For example,
CDCL solvers do not only learn many clauses, but they also aggressively
delete them to reduce the impact on unit propagation. Also, CDCL solvers
use techniques to rewrite the formula, so called inprocessing techniques.
In top-tier solvers, about half the runtime can be devoted to such
techniques.
