Beyond First-Order Logic
========================


Sorts
-----



Function types
--------------

.. function types and lambda

   introduce terminology, simple type theory

   mention untyped lambda calculus.

Higher-order logic
------------------

.. Can define quantifiers as functions to `Bool`. Often called `Prop` instead.

   Example: induction axiom

   Higher-order unification is undecidable.

   No system that is sound and complete for full second-order semantics.


Inductive Types

Dependent Types
