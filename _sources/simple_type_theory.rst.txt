Simple Type Theory
==================

..
    Lambda abstraction
    ------------------

    [Motivate this as a unifying abstraction for what has come before.
    All we really need is abstraction and application.]

    Simple types
    ------------

    [Sorts will allow us to distinguish between terms and formulas,
    and different kinds of terms and operations -- on integers, booleans,
    and so on.]

   [Can also specify types of functions sent as arguments, predicates, etc.]



   Higher-order logic
   ------------------

   [Quantifying over functions and predicates, comprehension.]
